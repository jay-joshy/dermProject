Lesions often appear dry and can bleed with abrasion, may look irregular and ‘heaped up’. Several phenotypes (ie exophytic cutaneous horn). Most common sites: face, ears, scalp, forearms, dorsum of hands;Biospy. Initial tissue sampling can be shave if raised lesion, punch of most abnormal area, or complete excision if lesion is small enough. <b>If there is ANY concern for melanoma, need full-thickness sample.</b>;<b>benign</b>: nummular eczema, psoriasis, irritated seborrheic keratosis+<b>pre-malignant</b>: Actinic Keratosis, Bowenoid papulosis+<b>malignant</b>: keratoacanthoma, Bowen’s disease, BCC, amelanotic melanoma;Consider referral to plastics / derm / ENT for surgical excision, the main treatment for SCC in situ. Mohs surgery. Lifelong follow-up (more aggressive treatment than BCC). Prevention: very careful sun protection;Second most common type of cutaneous neoplasm. Primarily on sun-exposed skin in the elderly, M>F. Most common cutaneous cancer in organ transplant recipients.+good prognostic factors: early treatment, negative margins, and small size of lesion+- SCCs from AK metastasize less frequently (~1%) than other SCCs arising de novo+- overall control is 75% over 5 yr, rate of metastasis from primary SCC is 2-5%+- metastasis rates are higher if diameter >2 cm, depth >4 mm, recurrent, involvement of bone/muscle/nerve, location on scalp/ears/nose/lips, immunosuppressed, caused by arsenic ingestion, or tumour arose from scar/chronic ulcer/burn/genital tract/sinus tract;Malignant neoplasm of keratinocytes (primarily vertical growth). Predisposing factors include: cumulative UV radiation, AK, PUVA, ionizing radiation therapy/exposure, chemical carcinogens (such as arsenic, tar, and nitrogen mustards), HPV 16, 18, immunosuppression. May occur in previous scar (SCC more commonly than BCC).;Cutaneous SCC is a common keratinocyte cancer most common in areas of sun exposure, often presenting with a hyperkeratotic indurated, pink/red/skin-coloured papule/plaque/nodule. Diagnosis is by biopsy, and treatment is largely excisional with lifelong follow-up.;<li>Toronto Notes 2020</li><li>https://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/0915/p873.html</li><li>https://www.aafp.org/afp/2020/0915/p339.html</li><li>https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/types/common/scc/symptoms</li><li>https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma</li>
