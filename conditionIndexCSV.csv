Less common in darker skin types (melanin is protective). <b>Risk factors for transformation</b>: immunosuppression, history of skin cancer, persistence of the AK.+While rare for a solitary actinic keratosis to transform to SCC (~1/1000 risk of transformation to SCC), worth noting <b> ~60% of SCC is from AK and that risk increases with persistence and # of lesions.</b>;UV radiation damage to keratinocytes from repeated sun exposure (especially UVB). Risk of transformation of AK to SCC (~1/1000), but higher likelihood if AK is persistent. ;AK is a very common pre-cancerous lesion secondary to sun-exposure more common in older patients. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, and management is aimed at destroying the pre-cancerous cells to prevent transformation into SCC, most often cyrotherapy. ;<li>https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/events/nc/handouts/nc17-derm2.pdf</li><li>Toronto Notes 2020</li><li>https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/actinic-keratosis-symptoms</li><li>https://dermnetnz.org/topics/actinic-keratosis</li>

Worse prognosis if: male, on scalp, hands, feet, late lesion, no pre-existing nevus present.;Transformation of melanocytic stem cells. Normally, melanocytes are found in the basal epidermis. Benign growths of melanocytes creates moles and freckles. As genetic mutations accumulate, melanoma can change from in-situ to invasive to metastatic.++Cutaneous melanoma can arise from otherwise normal-appearing skin (in about 75% of melanomas) or from within a mole or freckle, which starts to grow larger and change in appearance.;Melanoma is a malignant disease of melanocytes most often presenting as a unusual mole (think ABCDE).
