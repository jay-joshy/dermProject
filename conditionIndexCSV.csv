Risk of transformation of AK to SCC (~1/1000), but higher likelihood if AK is persistent. ;AK is a very common pre-cancerous lesion secondary to sun-exposure more common in older patients. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, and management is aimed at destroying the pre-cancerous cells to prevent transformation into SCC, most often cyrotherapy. ;<li>https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/events/nc/handouts/nc17-derm2.pdf</li><li>Toronto Notes 2020</li><li>https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/actinic-keratosis-symptoms</li><li>https://dermnetnz.org/topics/actinic-keratosis</li>

Worse prognosis if: male, on scalp, hands, feet, late lesion, no pre-existing nevus present.;Transformation of melanocytic stem cells. Normally, melanocytes are found in the basal epidermis. Benign growths of melanocytes creates moles and freckles. As genetic mutations accumulate, melanoma can change from in-situ to invasive to metastatic.++Cutaneous melanoma can arise from otherwise normal-appearing skin (in about 75% of melanomas) or from within a mole or freckle, which starts to grow larger and change in appearance.;Melanoma is a malignant disease of melanocytes most often presenting as a unusual mole (think ABCDE).

Psoriasis;psoriasis.html;red, erythema, plaque, scale, itchy, tender, nail, silver, joint pain+pediatric, adult, family history, diabetes, smoking+non-emergent+chronic inflammatory;images/psoriasis_01.jpg;A chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by defined, red and scaly plaques. Has subtypes.;Dry or red areas of skin, covered by silvery-white scales and sometimes with raised edges. Can occur anywhere, but most commonly at elbows, knees, scalp, chest, and lower back. If in skin folds, plaques often appear shiny with a moist peeling surface.++Itching and skin pain, sometimes severe - may be itch cycle with lichenification. May have joint pain, swelling or stiffness, nail abnormalities. When psoriatic plaques clear up, they may leave brown or pale marks that can be expected to fade over several months. Psoriasis may be permanent or episodic & plaques are usually very persistent without treatment. ;Subtypes include plaque, guttate, pustular, inverse and erthyrodermic. Some of these types may evolve from plaque psoriasis.;Diagnosis of psoriasis involves taking a careful history and conducting a physical examination. Biopsy is rarely needed. ;AD, mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma), seborrheic dermatitis, tinea, nummular dermatitis, lichen planus;Depends on severity of disease (ie by BSA affected). General lifestyle measures are smoking cessation, avoiding alcohol, maintaining optimal weight, using emollients. They should also be investigated for comorbidities associated with psoriasis.+<b>Mild (<3% BSA)</b>+Topicals 1st line: include topical corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogues, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors, anthralin and coal tar (most commonly start with topical steroids and/or topical vitamin D3 analogues, best tolerated). If lesions are scattered or in difficult to treat sites (palms, soles, scalp, genitals) consider phototherapy or systemic treatment.+<b>Moderate to severe</b>+Referral should be considered. Goal is symptom control. Continue with topicals, add phototherapy if possible, and use systemic therapy (ie DMARDs / biologics) based on patient’s treatment history and comorbidities;Peaks of onset: 20-30 yr old and 50-60 yr old. Most people who get psoriasis have it for life.  Psoriasis occurs equally among men and women. Polygenic inheritance. Risk factors: smoking, obesity, FHx, alcohol, drugs, infections, physical trauma (Koebner phenomenon)+Associated comorbidities: depression, anxiety and suicide. Arthritis, cardiac events, diabetes, cancer, liver disease.;Psoriasis has a genetic basis and about one-third of people with psoriasis have at least one family member with the disease. While the exact cause of psoriasis has not yet been determined, researchers believe it involves a combination of genetic, environmental and immune factors.+Flare-up triggers: emotional stress, local injury to skin, systemic infections, and the use of certain medications (ie Li, beta blockers, oral steroids with overuse or abrupt stop), dry cold weather in winter;Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease most commonly presenting with defined, red and scaly plaques. Diagnosis is mainly clinical, and focus of management is symptom control. First line treatments are topicals, but more severe cases will need systemic treatment (DMARDs/biologicals) and will likely need referral.;<li>https://dermnetnz.org/topics/psoriasis</li><li>https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/psoriasis/what/overview</li><li>https://dermatology.ca/public-patients/skin/psoriasis/</li><li>Toronto Notes 2020</li>
